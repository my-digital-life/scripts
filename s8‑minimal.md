Samsung S8 Ultra‑Minimal Debloat Script (ADB + PowerShell)

This project provides a safe, ultra‑minimal debloat script for the Samsung Galaxy S8 using ADB and PowerShell.  
I designed this for my 2 s8 devices that are no longer used as phones, and instead repurposed for:  
• 	Wi‑Fi‑only use  
• 	Camera  
• 	GPS  
• 	Google Maps  
• 	Lightweight utility tasks  
The script removes non‑essential Samsung, carrier, and third‑party bloatware while preserving all core system functionality.

✔ What This Script Removes  
• 	Facebook, Microsoft, Spotify, Instagram, WhatsApp  
• 	Samsung Bixby (all components)  
• 	Samsung Pay  
• 	Samsung VR/AR services  
• 	Samsung Routines  
• 	Samsung Edge panels  
• 	Samsung analytics + tracking  
• 	Carrier apps (Virgin / Rogers)  
• 	Flipboard + Yahoo Edge junk  
• 	Samsung preloaded apps not required for camera/GPS  

✔ What This Script Keeps (Safe)  
• 	Camera  
• 	Gallery  
• 	GPS  
• 	Google Maps  
• 	Google Play Services  
• 	Wi‑Fi  
• 	Bluetooth  
• 	OneUI launcher  
• 	Samsung Keyboard  
• 	System UI  
• 	Sensors  
This ensures the device remains fully functional as a camera + GPS + Wi‑Fi tool, while running significantly lighter and faster.

✔ Features  
• 	Ultra‑minimal debloat list tuned for Samsung S8  
• 	Automatic logging of every uninstall attempt  
• 	Success/Failure summary at the end  
• 	Log file saved in the same folder the script is run from  
• 	Safe for non‑rooted devices  
• 	No permanent system modifications (can be reversed with factory reset)  

✔ Requirements  
• 	Windows PC  
• 	ADB installed  
• 	USB debugging enabled on the device  
• 	Samsung Galaxy S8  

✔ How to Use  
1. 	Connect your Samsung device via USB  
2. 	Enable USB Debugging  
3. 	Open PowerShell in your ADB folder  
4. 	Run the script  
5. 	Review the generated log file for results  

✔ Disclaimer  
This script disables apps for user 0 using ADB.  
It does not modify system partitions and is fully reversible with a factory reset.  
Use at your own discretion.
